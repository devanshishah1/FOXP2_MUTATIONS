FOXP2 Gene Mutation Simulation

This project simulates random mutations in the FOXP2 gene and analyzes the types of mutations—substitutions, insertions, and deletions—that occur. The FOXP2 gene plays a crucial role in speech and language development, making it an interesting candidate for mutation analysis.
